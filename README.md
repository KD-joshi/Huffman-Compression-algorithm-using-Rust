# Huffman Coding in Rust
Huffman coding was one of the coding techniques I learnt in our digital communication classes.

This repository contains code for the proper implementation of the Huffman Algorithm in Rust programming Language.

Its a great compression algorithm to get a conceptual understanding of compression algorithms and its implementation with practical code.

I used binary tree and hash mapping concepts for assigning proper codewords.
